This is the multiplication runner that we made.

The overview of this game is to jump, slide, move, collect coins, and avoid obstacles. However, the math gatekeeper prevents you from getting to coins. To get past him, you need to solve a multiplication. You are given 5 seconds to solve it, as the math problem is quite simple(the game's point is to help kids memorize the tables). It gets faster as you go on, with more strenous obstacles, and more math problems.  This runner is infinite, and players are encouraged to go as far as they can. 

CONTROLS:
A/Left Arrow = Move Left
D/Right Arrow = Move Right
W/Up Arrow = Jump
S/Down Arrow = Slide
P = Pause
C = Continue

Multiplication problems go up to 13 * 13.

Note: This game is in BETA so bugs are quite likely.


Enjoy :)
